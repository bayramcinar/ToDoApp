# ToDoApp
In this project, I made a TO-DO App. While making this I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how can I use Local Storage in JavaScript. There is an input area in the app. You can add your content from there. You can edit your contents. Also, you can delete them or mark them as you have done.
